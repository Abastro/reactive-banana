### Misc
* Concurrency / network programming
    "I would like to see an application where you have a server and a number of clients.
Each client has a gui containing a circle that they can move by dragging it with the mouse. Each client can only see their own circle.
The server has a gui where you can see all the circles as they move around, tagged with the name of the client that owns each circle."

* GUI for a command line program
    transformation between files in a directory
* Chess GUI
* "Open" systems, i.e. involving external data, like network, file system etc.
* Color picker, font chooser, file chooser

* How about a Morse code signal generator using a single key of a keyboard and a corresponding signal decoder?  I'd think that would be a very enlightening example.

### Difficult examples
* small vector drawing application (or GUI designer)
    events from drawn shapes
* arpeggiator for MIDI events (delay existing events to repeat them in the future)
* dynamic widgets and windows

### Animations
* Table of Contents - http://sjoerdvisscher.handcraft.com/treenav
* Final Fantasy style game
    "You wouldn't need a whole game :) I'm thinking of something like a 50x50 grid map with a 20x20 view portal on it. A character moving around under user control, causing the portal to scroll, and maybe 2 or 3 non user controlled characters moving randomly. The interactions between animation, multiple characters, user input and map scrolling would be very interesting using FRP."
